            While Boswell's personal acquaintance with his subject only began in 1763,
            when Johnson was 54 years old, Boswell covered the entirety of Johnson's life by means of additional
            research. Itself an important stage in the development of the modern genre of biography, it has been
            claimed to be the greatest biography written in the English language. Boswell's work was unique in its
            level of research, which involved archival study, eye-witness accounts and interviews, its robust and
            attractive narrative, and its honest depiction of all aspects of Johnson's life and character - a
            formula which serves as the basis of biographical literature to this day.
